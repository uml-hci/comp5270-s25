# Discord

Please feel free to join the class Discord. You will find the link on Blackboard. We will use Discord (optionally) for asynchronous discussion and team coordination.

When you join, you must make sure your name is something that identifies you as a student enrolled in the class. I will remove accounts if I cannot tell who they are.

Discord is primarily a discussion forum and coordination tool. Questions for me about class logistics, deadlines, etc. are best addressed over email or in office hours.
